      <p>I created the overall structure of the application (the lenses) and worked with my teammembers to brainstorm around their lenses and the overall structure (16h)</p>
      <p>Attended group meetings 10h</p>
      <p>Worked with creating the lost in transtion lens. This work consisted of going through a lot of iterations, evaluating them in relation to the question we were asking and applying those to the next iteration. Wrote a lot of code for this lens 40h</p>
      <p>Helped out with the construction and later stage bug fixing for the "Screening" lens 8h</p>
      <p>Presenter for the project at various stages and created the presentations for those events 10h</p>
      <h3 id="2-how-did-you-coordinate-as-a-team-did-you-respond-to-communication-promptly-">2. How did you coordinate as a team? Did you respond to communication promptly?</h3>
      <p>We started out having meetings and continued to do so when needed. However we transistioned to using Slack as our primary communication. I responeded promptly to any question or communication through Slack.</p>
      <h3 id="3-name-the-tasks-that-you-worked-on-and-did-not-make-the-final-cut-">3. Name the tasks that you worked on and did not make the final cut.</h3>
      <p>Worked on a first sankey implementation using a d3->react combo library. This library proved not to be good enough and we ended up scraping it and using vanilla d3. 20h</p>
      <h3 id="4-what-did-you-learn-from-contributing-to-the-project-">4. What did you learn from contributing to the project.</h3>
      <p>Through our iterations I learned a lot about the pros and cons of the visualisations we used. Also learned a lot about d3 and building modular applications using React. </p>
