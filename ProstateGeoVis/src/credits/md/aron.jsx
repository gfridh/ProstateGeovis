      <p>I tried to lead the technical side of building our website. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I created the backbone of our React application, and worked with some general issues. (30h)</li>
        <li>I acted as a &quot;consultant&quot; if you will, and helped other team members solving issues with React and git (version control) (10h)</li>
        <li>I was part of the team building the <em>Lost in transit</em> visualization (20h)</li>
        <li>I created this credits page. (2h)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="2-how-did-you-coordinate-as-a-team-did-you-respond-to-communication-promptly-">2. How did you coordinate as a team? Did you respond to communication promptly?</h3>
      <p>We used Slack as our primary means of communcations. This generally worked well (definitely better than e.g. facebook), but Slack takes some practice before you learn to use it effectively. I think I responsed quickly to best of my ability. </p>
