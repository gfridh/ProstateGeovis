    <h3 id="1-what-did-i-contribute-with-to-the-team-">1. What did I contribute with to the team?</h3>
    <p>I made the map over Stockholm, color scheme, buttons and other UX/UI features.<br/>Code monkey, mainly worked with the parallel coordinates but also helped   others in their parts.<br/>Video demo.</p>
    <h3 id="2-how-did-you-coordinate-as-a-team-did-you-respond-to-communication-promptly-">2. How did you coordinate as a team? Did you respond to communication  promptly?</h3>
    <p>Almost all communication was done via Slack or meetings, which worked rather well.<br/>We decided that splitting into smaller groups of two would be the best  way when dividing the programming tasks.<br/>A group chat consisting of nine people is sometimes hectic but I responded as soon as I could when addressed.   </p>
    <h3 id="3-name-the-tasks-that-you-worked-on-and-did-not-make-the-final-cut-">3. Name the tasks that you worked on and did not make the final cut.</h3>
    <p>Worked hard with getting the parallel coordinates to operate with the map but failed in doing so.<br/>Some design choices.  </p>
    <h3 id="4-what-did-you-learn-from-contributing-to-the-project-">4. What did you learn from contributing to the project.</h3>
    <p>Obviously I learned more about D3.<br/>React the framework.  </p>
