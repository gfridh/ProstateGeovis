      <ul>
        <li>My main task was to create the “Who dies”-lense. Since I didn’t know any D3 nor React this took quite some time. I’d estimate around 30-35h, but impossible to say.</li>
        <li>I also took part in creating the C-award film, took about 6h. </li>
        <li>Investigated Mapbox at the beginning of the project to see if we should use it. 3h </li>
        <li>Investigated other dimensions than the ones we got from KI, like education level in each municipality. 4h</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="2-how-did-you-coordinate-as-a-team-did-you-respond-to-communication-promptly-">2. How did you coordinate as a team? Did you respond to communication promptly?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We used Slack as communication and git to keep track of what needed to be done and also had several meetings. Since most of us had no previous experience of D3 and React, we spent a lot of time getting accustomed to it. In hindsight this was a great way to learn, but made the project so much more difficult and time consuming.</li>
        <li>I responded promptly when there was something I could contribute with. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="3-name-the-tasks-that-you-worked-on-and-did-not-make-the-final-cut-">3. Name the tasks that you worked on and did not make the final cut.</h3>
      <ul>  
        <li>We decided not to use Mapbox since we wouldn’t have any use of most of the functionality in it. </li>
        <li>We decided to not use the other dimensions I investigated since the ones we got from KI were enough.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="4-what-did-you-learn-from-contributing-to-the-project-">4. What did you learn from contributing to the project.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I learned the basics of D3 and react.</li>
        <li>How to work with a real-life project and how to cope with difficulties like scrambled and anonymized data.</li>
        <li>General web-programming</li>
      </ul>
