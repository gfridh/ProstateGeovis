    My main role was to produce data files for the team.
    <ol>
      <li>Investigate possible tools for data management and learned pandas 5h</li>
      <li>Analyzed the data 8h</li>
      <li>Constructed various csv files, as requested by the groups, with sql ish queries 8h</li>
      <li>Cleaned up data, ex. I found where people lived had lived the most and assigned that as the location of each person , instead of a location per event, got data into good formats etc. 10h</li>
      <li>I created a file with histories of all events of all persons. This file was easy to use but slow 4h</li>
      <li>Made the map interactive 8h</li>
      <li>Tried to make Sankey chart faster 8h</li>
      <li>Filled the C-awards project template. 1h</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="2-how-did-we-coordinate-as-a-team">2. How did we coordinate as a team</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>It worked quite well to use slack for coordination. I think we had a problem with that there was no clear leader in our group, and I think that is almost a requirement if you have this big of a group. Obviously, most people took this course to be able to learn about visualization, so I think that smaller groups would be better for the next year, especially considering the short project time.</li>
      <li>I Think I responded to communications promptly most of the time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="3-name-the-tasks-you-worked-on-and-did-not-make-the-final-cut">3. Name the tasks you worked on and did not make the final cut</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Tried to use a couch db database too speed up Sankey queries, this wasn’t a good fit to our kind of queries however.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="4-what-did-you-learn-from-contributing-from-to-the-project">4. What did you learn from contributing from to the project</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I learned to use the pandas framework in python to query and manipulate the data.</li>
      <li>I learned to use basic react and learned more about d3.</li>
      <li>How important it is to have a group leader in a project of this sizes.</li>
    </ol>
