      <h2>Robin Gileborg</h2>
      <h3 id="general-contributions">General contributions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepared the first presentation together with Peter Finnman, and communicating tasks to the rest of the group. 4 hours</li>
        <li>Coordinated meetings together with several others in the project, during meeting I kept the discussion relevant and maintained the focus on the contributing topics. Probably 2 hours per meeting for 5 or so meetings. </li>
        <li>Implementing features using a javascript library together with Axel Hultman, the library later proved to be out-dated which we didn’t realize until problems occured. 16 hours or so probably.</li>
        <li>Meetings with the KI research team, attended every one of them, sometimes as the sole representative of our project. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="contributions-in-the-final-project">Contributions in the final product:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked together with Aron Strandberg and Axel Hultman on the “Lost in Transit” feature. Both in feature development and in design choices. </li>
        <li>Acted as fire exstinguisher and merge controller for the “Who Dies” feature, helping them intregrate their feature into our platform, both through guidance of other members and finally as clean-up for a fully functional merge. 5-6 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="throughout-the-project">Throughout the project:</h3>
      <p>Acted mediator for many features, helping out wherever possible. Being active on our Slack, both requesting feature advancements, scheduling meetings and answering questions from other members. Impossible to estimate time spent on this, but given that I use Slack in other instances as well my presence there was pretty much constant. </p>
      <h3 id="learnings">Learnings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It's can be difficult to manage a team of separate qualifications, especially when the motivating may be out of sync.</li>
        <li>I’ve learned that info-vis relies more on design and visual appeal than upon complexity and technologies used behind the scenes. </li>
        <li>I’ve also learned that pie charts are worthless, deceiving and cannot be trusted.</li>
      </ul>
