        <li>Brainstorming, some of us worked on sketching the designing and functionality of the application, 3h</li>
        <li>Writing all the code for one of the application’s three “lenses” 30- 40h (Includes learning React.js)</li>

      <p>I think it worked quite well, although we didn’t really have someone taking the leader role which made everything slower and less efficient.<br/>Until the final presentation I worked my ass of and responded to almost everything. After the course should’ve ended I’ve been a bit more laid back since I felt I’d done my share.</p>
      <h3 id="3-name-the-tasks-that-you-worked-on-and-did-not-make-the-final-cut-">3. Name the tasks that you worked on and did not make the final cut.</h3>
      <p>Worked with a group member on a parallel diagram that turned out to be a bad idea for the purpose of our lens.<br/>Bug fixes on my lens that worked before the final presentation but not after (correct axes and correct updates on the diagrams).</p>
      <h3 id="4-what-did-you-learn-from-contributing-to-the-project-">4. What did you learn from contributing to the project.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The basics of React.js and D3.js.</li>
        <li>Tons of javascript overall.</li>
        <li>That in a programming project of 9 people it is hard to work as a team.</li>
